# Project 18 - Layout and geometry

In our final technique project for these 100 days, we’ll be looking at how SwiftUI handles layout and geometry. Yes, I realize you might have expected this kind of thing to be covered much earlier, but one of the great things about SwiftUI is that it does so much work for us – that this kind of tutorial appears so late in this series is testament to how good SwiftUI’s standard layout is.

## Features

* How layout works in SwiftUI
* Alignment and alignment guides
* How to create a custom alignment guide
* Absolute positioning for SwiftUI views
* Resizing images to fit the screen using GeometryReader
* Understanding frames and coordinates inside GeometryReader
* ScrollView effects using GeometryReader
* ScrollView effects using visualEffect() and scrollTargetBehavior()
